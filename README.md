 # README

 A group project from first year, in which we had free roam to create a text based adventure game to showcase our HTML, CSS & Javascript skills.
 
 I created the theme and all of the graphics. My favourite part to make was the 'dog attack' part and the tidy countdown timer on this page.
 
 If using Google Chrome browser, some of the pages look better at 75%. Feature or bug? ðŸ‘€
 
 Instructions to use: 
 
 You'll find all you need at https://ispy-text-based-adventure-game.herokuapp.com/ . Good luck!
